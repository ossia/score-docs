You can either generate object-based spatial audio scenes completely within score, leverage industry-standard sound spatialization plug-ins, or act purely as a controller for separate sound spatialization servers such as SpatGRIS. Some of the main features are: . | DBAP - Works with any speaker layout, handles irregular arrangements. | GBAP - Grid-based spatialization for regular speaker arrays. | Faust spatialization - Including professional libraries like abclib for VBAP and ambisonics as well as simpler circular spatializers. | Matrix Spatialization for routing - Applying a spatialization matrix to the actual speakers. | SpatGRIS control - built-in support for the SpatGRIS OSC API. | Channel-based spatialization - many audio effects will scale to the number of input channels and will allow polyphonic controls. | . In addition, score supports loading many kinds of audio plug-ins: VST, JSFX, etc. For instance, the SPARTA and IEM suites of audio plug-ins are well-suited to sound spatialization ; likewise, it is possible to use the Reaper Ambitools inside ossia, and even combine all these tools together.

Note: it is also possible to simulate sound spatialization with headphones thanks to HRTF plug-ins and objects. | A spatialization trajectory: 2D or 3D position changes that will move the source over time. | A spatialization algorithm: given trajectories and loudspeakers, computes how much of the signal spreads to each loudspeaker. This can be for instance DBAP, GBAP, VBAP or even a custom algorithm tailored to the use-case at hand. | . This can come from instance from pre-written trajectories with the 2D Spline object, or from tools such as Path generator. Finally, the Matrix Spatialization object will take the sound source and the loudspeaker weights output by the spatialization algorithm, and output the resulting audio signal. Let’s create a simple moving sound that travels in a circle around a 4-speaker (classic quadriphonic) setup. 1. Set up your speakers . First, tell score about your speaker arrangement: . | For this example we will operate mainly in patch mode. Switch to patch mode with the relevant toggle. | Add a Multi-Cursor Manager object and add four points: these will represent our loudspeakers. Remember that it is possible to visualize the loudspeakers with the Point2D View object. Alternatively, you can use Arraygen or Expression Value Generator to generate position through simple math expressions: for Arraygen, return [ cos(2pi i / n), sin(2pi i / n) ]; would for instance lay out points on a circle. Expression Value Generator is the easiest way to directly return coordinates: return [ 0, 0, 1, -1, 2, -2 ]; | Add a sound file from your collection by dropping it in the interface, and make it loop from the inspector. | . 2. Add movement . Now let’s make the sound move: . | Add a Path generator object and draw a simple line. The trajectory will loop over that line. Other modes are for circular and spiral motion, with more to be added over time. | Add a DBAP process. | Add a Matrix Spatialization process. Set the appropriate number of outputs for your layout. | Now, let’s connect everything: | . | The multi-cursor or expression defining the loudspeaker layout’s output goes to the first DBAP inlet. | The path generator output goes to the “Source” DBAP inlet as it is what defines the movement of our spatialized audio source. | The DBAP output goes into the Matrix’s data inlet. | The sound file output goes into the Matrix’s audio inlet. | .

Built-in spat algorithms . The Faust standard library includes sp.spat - a professional circular spatialization algorithm developed by Laurent Pottier: it assumes that the listening point is surrounded by a circle of speakers. // 8-channel circular spatialization process = vgroup(\"Spatializer\", sp.spat(8, angle, distance)); . To use it: . | Drop the spat Faust preset from the user library | Connect angle and distance controls from your spatial controllers | Customize for your speaker count by editing the Faust code | . abclib: advanced spatial audio library . The abclib package provides professional spatial audio tools: . Ambisonics processing: . | 2D ambisonics up to order 7 (supporting 3-15 channels) | Encoders and decoders for different speaker layouts | Rotation and optimization tools for perfect speaker alignment | .

Polyphonic spatial effects . Many audio effects in score automatically become polyphonic when you feed them multichannel audio, which opens another possibility for spatial processing. How it works: . | Single effect, multiple channels: The Audio Effects automatically process each channel independently | List-based control: Instead of single float values, send lists to control each channel separately | Perfect for spatial audio: Apply different reverb to each speaker, or chorus effects that vary by position | . Example workflow: . [Spatial Audio Source] → [DBAP 8-channel] → [Polyphonic Reverb] → [Speakers] ↑ [List of 8 different reverb amounts] . Creative uses: . | Position-dependent effects: More reverb for distant speakers | Spatial coloration: Different EQ for each spatial zone | Dynamic spatial processing: Effects that change as sounds move | . Note that for Faust effects, it is important to make sure that the effect is mono (one input / one output). Many effects in the Faust library come with the stereo assumption: they may require slight change in their code to switch to polyphonic mode. For instance: consider the smoothDelay.dsp file: . import(\"stdfaust.lib\"); process = par(i, 2, voice) with { voice = (+ : de.sdelay(N, interp, dtime)) ~ *(fback); N = int(2^19); interp = hslider(\"interpolation[unit:ms][style:knob]\",10,1,100,0.1)*ma.SR/1000.0; dtime = hslider(\"delay[unit:ms][style:knob]\", 0, 0, 5000, 0.1)*ma.SR/1000.0; fback = hslider(\"feedback[style:knob]\",0,0,100,0.1)/100.0; }; . The par(i, 2, voice) command instantiates the effect for two channels for stereo processing. To put it in mono mode, change 2 to 1 in that line. ",

In this case, the interval’s execution must reach its end before it can be restarted. If the trigger is enabled at the end of the loop, it provides flexible time to the interval. As soon as the interval begins executing, it can be interrupted by the validation of the trigger and transition back to the beginning. ",

Expanding on the prior example, switching between an idle state and an interval, a similar structure could enclose two intervals. This switch also requires an extra trigger. With the default “Pulse” operators to validate each trigger, this structure will return to the idle state after each transition. To avoid this extra step and make sure that the first interval executes every time the button’s value is true and that the second executes every time it is false, the expression for the trigger has to be modified. By setting both the start and end triggers to only respond when the value is true, they can be validated in a row, skipping the idle state after the transition.  . A better way of achieving the same result would be to rely on a sub-scenario to isolate the loop. Since the first trigger is only needed to control the very first execution of the loop, it can be validated once to enter the sub-scenario and omitted in the actual toggle structure. The trigger at the end of the sub-scenario is left “never” valid to allow as many repetitions as needed. It may be preferable to switch at every press of the button, instead of having to hold for the first interval and let go for the second. Adding a minimum duration on each of the toggled intervals ensures that the value of the button can go back to false without validating the next trigger. This method also protects the switch from accidental “double taps”. ",

    "content": "Consecutive switches shown above can sequence an arbitrary number of intervals, but only in the same order every time. To enable switching as well as reordering, we can rely on conditional branches. Let’s first create another device for control. For this example we will add a mapper device by copying and pasting the script below. We will name it “Structure”. import Ossia 1.0 as Ossia Ossia.Mapper { function createTree() { return [ { name: \"Branch\", type: Ossia.Type.Int, write: function(v) { return v.value; } } ]; } } . Parallel branches start from the same Sync. Syncing them at the end too will also make them responsive to the same trigger and allow us to only set up one transition to loop the entire structure. To add conditions for each start state of parallel intervals, they have to be split into individual events with the “Split condition” function. The state connecting the transition back to the initial Sync does not require a condition. Finally, a trigger on the end Sync can reset the loop with every new value set in the mapper. It is now possible to switch between parallel intervals when setting a value to the “Branch” parameter. To control the start of the structure when played the first time, we have to avoid adding a trigger to the start sync of the loop. It would add an idle state as we experienced before and skip the evaluation of every other value. Instead we can isolate this switch from its initial trigger with another transition, similar to our solution to looping parallel branches. ",

This of course begs the question of: what should happen when asking score to transport at any given point when the score has not started playing ? . The policy taken by score is to follow the visual duration set for intervals. That is, that visual duration even for a fully interactive interval is not entirely devoid of semantic meaning: it can be taken as to mean: . The duration that I expect this part of the score to last. In particular, this means that any interactive point before the point to which the transport is performed will be triggered.

Thankfully, score takes this into account: by default, when running a transport action if the score is not playing, every state leading to the transported point is computed from the beginning of the score. If multiple states send different values, then the last one is taken into account: that is, if making a transport after the end of the example score shown above, the player will receive the messages: . player:/play false player:/volume 0 .

Whenever you push a new commit, Github will automatically compile the plug-in for Mac, Windows and Linux. | Create a repository from the template by clicking on the green “Use this template” button. | . For instance, let’s say your personal repository will be: https://github.com/yourself/foobinator and your plug-in name is Foobinator. | Clone your new repository: | . $ git clone git@github.com:yourself/foobinator . | If your shell is zsh, run ./init.zsh Foobinator, otherwise ./init.sh Foobinator | . This will replace the generic names in the repository by your custom name, Foobinator and auto-generate unique identifiers. | Set-up your plug-in’s name and description inside the addon.json file. | Set-up git again – the script removes the existing local git repo to make sure you can start from a clean state, without the template repo git history. | . $ git remote add origin git@github.com:yourself/foobinator $ git add . $ git commit -m 'First commit' $ git push --set-upstream origin main --force . | After some minutes, you can check the “SDK” action of the plug-in on Github: | . https://github.com/yourself/foobinator/actions/workflows/builds-sdk.yaml . If everything is ok, it should have generated a “plugin” archive which will contain the MacOS, Windows and Linux builds.

In short: . | Create an empty “development” folder and clone or move your repository in it | . $ mkdir dev $ cd dev $ git clone git@github.com:yourself/foobinator . | Download and run this script: https://github.com/ossia/score/raw/master/tools/fetch-sdk.sh which will download required compilers and libraries. | From score’s package manager, download the SDK which will contain the header files that match this version of score. | . It will be installed in ~/Documents/ossia/score/sdk/&lt;VERSION&gt; .

Starting from 3.1.9 this will be fixed, but until then use this: https://github.com/ossia/score/releases/tag/continuous . For instance on Linux: . $ mkdir -p ~/Documents/ossia/score/sdk $ cd ~/Documents/ossia/score/sdk $ wget https://github.com/ossia/score/releases/download/continuous/linux-sdk.zip $ 7z x linux-sdk.zip -ocontinuous . | Run CMake (this step will only be needed the first time) | . $ cd dev $ export SCORE_SDK=/path/to/Documents/ossia/score/sdk/3.1.x # Or if you downloaded the \"continuous\" SDK as mentioned above: $ export SCORE_SDK=/path/to/Documents/ossia/score/sdk/continuous # If on windows: $ export OSSIA_SDK=c:/ossia-sdk $ export PATH=$OSSIA_SDK/llvm/bin:$PATH $ export CC=clang $ export CXX=clang++ # If on mac: $ export OSSIA_SDK=/opt/ossia-sdk-x86_64 # If on Linux: $ export OSSIA_SDK=/opt/ossia-sdk $ export PATH=$OSSIA_SDK/llvm/bin:$PATH $ export CC=clang $ export CXX=clang++ $ cmake -S foobinator \\ -B foobinator-build-release \\ -GNinja \\ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \\ -DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH=\"$SCORE_SDK/usr/lib/cmake/score\" \\ -DSCORE_SDK=\"$SCORE_SDK/usr\" \\ -DOSSIA_SDK=\"$OSSIA_SDK\" \\ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/Documents/ossia/score/packages/my_plugin . | Run a build | . $ cmake --build foobinator-build-release $ cmake --install foobinator-build-release . This should copy the plug-in in the ossia/score/packages/&lt;your plugin&gt; folder. If everything is correct, the next time you launch score you should see your plug-in show up in the Process library :-) . Another way for fast iteration is to create a symbolic lijnk from the foobinator-build-release/plugins folder to ossia/score/packages/&lt;your plugin&gt;.

The result is that signature “whoosh” sound - think jet planes or the intro to “Itchycoo Park”. You can shape the flanging effect with these controls: . Amount (0.0 - 0.01) How deep the delay modulation goes. Start around 0.001 for subtle effects, push to 0.003+ for dramatic swooshes. Delay (0.0 - 10.0 ms) The center delay time that the LFO sweeps around. Short delays (0.5-2ms) give tight flanging, longer delays approach chorus territory. Frequency (0.001 - 100.0 Hz) Speed of the sweep. Try 0.2 Hz for slow, hypnotic sweeps or crank it up to 5+ Hz for tremolo-like effects. Feed-forward (-0.99 - 0.99) Mixes the delayed signal with the original. Positive values create upward sweeps, negative creates downward swooshes. Feed-back (-0.99 - 0.99) Sends the output back into the delay line for resonance and emphasis. Higher values make the effect more pronounced. Try these settings: For that classic jet plane sound, use Amount: 0.003, Delay: 2.0ms, Frequency: 0.2Hz, Feed-forward: 0.8, Feed-back: 0.6. For a subtle chorus-like effect, dial back to Amount: 0.001, Delay: 8.0ms, Frequency: 0.1Hz, Feed-forward: 0.3, Feed-back: 0.1. ",

Keep it low (0.2-0.3) for single echoes, push it higher for long tails that fade into ambient washes. Filter (0.0 - 1.0) A low-pass filter that makes echoes sound more natural. Lower values give you darker, warmer repeats that sit nicely in the mix without getting harsh. Dry/Wet (0.0 - 1.0) Balances your original signal with the echoes. Start around 0.2-0.3 for musical delays, or push higher for special effects.

When triggered, following automations and states will get executed at the speed and duration specified in the scenario. To add a trigger point, simply select a state on the scenario, then from its inspector, toggle on the trigger icon. When turning on the trigger, you can see a T-like icon appearing on top of the selected state. You can also note that a dashed line appears on top of the preceding automation slot. This indicates that the duration of the preceding automations is now undefined: preceding automations will get executed up until the trigger is, well… triggered. In the example above, the scenario start with a simple fade-in. Notice that it gets executed as the scenario play-head goes across the automation slot. While the scenario play-head continues its progression, you will notice though that the green progression bar at the top of the automation stops as it reaches the trigger point. Execution of the following automations is then on hold until the trigger point is triggered by a mouse click. From then, execution follows its course until the next trigger point in the scenario.

This process allows to calibrate an input signal to extract the “significant” part of the signal, when it is impossible to define an accurate range of values at the time the score is being authored: for instance, consider a temperature sensor. Its range as defined in the Device explorer could be between -30°C and 70°C. However, the daily variations could be sometimes around 15°, sometimes around 25°… with most of the range being unused. The Calibrator object outputs values between 0 and 1, by computing over time the actual minimum and maximum of the input values and scaling between those. In addition, it allows to access a few statistics on the input signal. The effective range can further be adjusted and shaped. To get its output, simply connect to the “Scaled” output. In this example, the input of the calibrator is connected to the sensors:/temperature sensor, which has a range of 0-100°. But if the inputs of the process only vary between 10° and 30° while the installation is runnning, the scaled output will be 0 for 10° and 1 for 30°. ",

The main differences are: . | We are in a compute shader: unlike vertex or fragment shaders, no input or output are predefined. It is up to the user to define the resources that the shader is going to operate upon. | The JSON header must contain the key: . | . \"MODE\": \"COMPUTE_SHADER\", . | The \"IMAGE\" type which creates a texture in ISF and VSA, creates an image in compute shaders. Use the \"TEXTURE\" type to create a sampled texture accessible with textureLod(...) instead of an image accessible with imageLoad and imageStore. | It is possible to refer to the width and height of another image in the JSON header with the $WIDTH_otherImageName and $HEIGHT_otherImageName macros (and, like ISF, use them as part of normal math formulas and expressions). | \"PASSES\" are mandatory as they define how the compute shader is going to be invoked. At least one pass is necessary. | . The pass syntax is slightly different from the ISF one as it needs to bring data relevant to compute shaders: . | The shader’s local size | How many workgroups are used | . For instance: assuming outputImage is 1020 x 770 pixels. Then: . { \"LOCAL_SIZE\": [16, 16, 1], \"EXECUTION_MODEL\": { \"TYPE\": \"MANUAL\", \"WORKGROUPS\": [64, 1, 1] } } . will translate to: . layout(local_size_x = 16, local_size_y = 16, local_size_z = 1​) in; void glDispatchCompute(64, 1, 1); . { \"LOCAL_SIZE\": [16, 16, 1], \"EXECUTION_MODEL\": { \"TYPE\": \"2D_IMAGE\", \"TARGET\": \"outputImage\" } } . will translate to: . layout(local_size_x = 16, local_size_y = 16, local_size_z = 1​) in; void glDispatchCompute((1020 + 16 - 1) / 16​, (770 + 16 - 1) / 16, 1); e.g. void glDispatchCompute(64, 49, 1); . which translates into (64 * 16) * (49 * 16) = 1024 * 784 invocations.

This ensures the panning keeps consistent energy regardless of the number of affected sinks. | Sink (X or Y) # : Defines how many sinks (speakers/outputs) are placed horizontally (X) and vertically (Y) in the 2D grid. | Sinks Size : Sets the size (width and height) of each sink’s influence zone in the grid. Larger sizes make sinks cover more area. | Cursor Size : Represents the area of influence (e.g., a sound source) within the grid. Bigger cursors affect more sinks, resulting in broader spatial panning. | . ",

The most important thing for the process is the definition of the zones. Zones are defined through a simple JSON syntax: . [ // Root array containing the zones { // First zone \"polygon\": [ // Points of the polygon in lat / lon [45.528668022454156, -73.59866480075671], [45.528640776488615, -73.59863261424853], [45.52871155322648, -73.59861115657641] ], // All the other members will be associated with the zone \"variable1\": 0.1, // Numbers will be interpolated depending on the blur radius \"variable2\": \"Foo\" }, { // Second zone \"polygon\": [ [45.52895895772783, -73.59866748296572], [45.52878514835371, -73.59859506332232], [45.52880409516411, -73.59868491732432], [45.528858743384646, -73.59878281795336], [45.528947213892906, -73.59873319708659] ], \"variable1\": 0.81, \"variable2\": \"Foo|Bar\" // String values act as enumerations, with | indicating that multiples values are present. }, ] .

Important note: due to the way numbers work in Javascript (that is, double-precision floating point numbers), and due to the timing units, scripts can only be expected to be accurate for representing durations no greater than 147 days. That is, if a time interval lasts a year, after 147 days the timing values returned by prev_date, date, … may not be accurate anymore. This limit is pushed back to the hard limit of 414 years when using the C++ integer-based API instead. Note that this does not affect for instance, scores with normal durations which would loop back to the beginning - permanently running installations are safe. Properties . | previous_date: the model date at which the tick starts. | date: the model date at which the tick ends | parent_duration: the nominal model duration of the closest parent interval. | offset: the model date at which we must start reading from our input. | speed: current speed (a multiplicative factor). | tempo: current tempo. | musical_start_last_signature: what is the position in quarter notes of the closest previous musical signature change to previous_date. | musical_start_last_bar: what is the position in quarter notes of the closest previous bar change to previous_date. | musical_start_position: what is the position of previous_date in quarter notes. | musical_end_last_bar: what is the position in quarter notes of the closest previous musical signature change to date. | musical_end_position: what is the position of date in quarter notes. | signature_upper: 6 in “6/8”, at the start of the tick. | signature_lower: 8 in “6/8”, at the start of the tick. | . Methods . | logical_read_duration(): how long are we reading from the model data. | physical_start(ratio): at which sample in the output must we start to write. | physical_read_duration(ratio): how many samples are we reading from the input ports. | physical_write_duration(ratio): how many samples are we writing to the output ports. | to_physical_time_in_tick(time, ratio): convert a model time into a physical time. | from_physical_time_in_tick(time, ratio): convert a time in physical dates, to a time in model dates. | in_range(time): check that the model time given is indeed in the range of this tick. | position(): where are we in relation to our parent interval. 0 is the beginning, 1 is the nominal duration. If an interval has a greater max, or is infinite, this will go beyond 1. | forward(): is the time going forward in this tick (speed &gt; 0). | backward(): is the time going backward in this tick (speed &lt; 0). | paused(): is the time going anywhere in this tick (speed == 0). Note that there is a difference between setting the speed to zero, and pressing the “pause” button - in the first case, processes will still keep being executed, just with no duration. | get_quantification_date(quant): get a model date if there is a quantification date for the requested quantification in this tick. -1 is returned if there isn’t any. | get_physical_quantification_date(quant, ratio): get a physical date if there is a quantification date for the requested quantification in this tick. -1 is returned if there isn’t any. | . State object . The state object contains global properties relevant for the whole score execution. Properties . | sample_rate: explicit. | buffer_size: explicit. | model_to_physical: the ratio to pass to the token functions going from model to physical dates. | physical_to_model: the ratio to pass to the token functions going from physical to model dates. | physical_date: how many samples have elapsed since the score has started playing. | start_date_ns: the date in nanoseconds when the score started playing. | current_date_ns: the current date in nanoseconds. | timings(token): given the token object, this gives back a timings object, which has the following properties: . | start_sample: at which index is the first sample to write in an audio buffer. | length: how many samples must be written. | . | . timings is most of the time what you need ! .

Channel (0-16) - Filter by MIDI channel (0 = all channels) . Index (0-128) - Filter by parameter number (0 = all, 1-128 for specific CC numbers, note numbers, etc.) .

While trigger points bring flexibility in a timeline-based approach, things can be pushed a step further. You remember we noted in the Saving and recalling devices state page that score offers to connect dropped namespace selection to different preceding elements in the scenario. score also provides several ways to connect elements, one of them allowing to write and organize elements pretty much like you would do when designing a state machine. To learn about the various connections features, please refer to the in-depth topics as well as the reference manual to see how score engine works and the advanced authoring features it provides. In the scenario editor panel, you may create some elements by dragging a connection to a point in the timeline where you want to store a namespace state or start a process. This is where the create widget comes handy. In the illustration below, we can see that selecting a namespace state stored in the timeline brings the create widget: the yellow, blue and red crosses icons. We will focus here on the red one: it allows to escape the timeline constraint and automatically trigger elements attached to that connection. As seen above, clicking the red cross allows us to drag a connection up to anywhere in the timeline. From there, we may adjust our device settings and drag a namespace selection from the Device explorer to store its state as seen earlier. What’s happening here? Well, we are starting to scratch the surface of score’s special strength. When playing our scenario, score will recall our parameters’ stored states and execute automations as the play-head runs through the timeline, just like we saw earlier. But when reaching the starting point of this dashed connection, the play-head will kind of jump to the connected elements and continue the reading as time regularly passes by. This might look weird coming from a timeline-based approach but is actually extremely useful. While score can help to author elements of precise duration and evolution over time using its timeline as a default grid, it also allows to author state machine-like scenarios by patching timed processes.

Of course, you can still use some trigger points so the scenario waits before jumping to the next point. ",

Within OSCQuery, a server is a host that provides a JSON data blob that describes the hierarchy of an OSC Address Space in a format that is both easy for humans and machine to interpret. Descriptions can include the type of data that is expected, the range of values that are accepted and other information about each container and method within the address space. Within OSCQuery, a client refers to a piece of software that browses and interacts with a remote server’s OSC address space. Read Vidvox’s detailed article to learn more about OSCQuery. ",

These processes can either be actions evolving during a given duration, such as automation of a given device’s parameter, or actions activated only in a defined duration, such as mapping or LFO modulations. Processes are attached to an interval in the scenario when they represent an evolving behaviour, and to a state when they are instantaneous. ",

The interval to which processes will be attached turns to yellow as the mouse with selection hovers it. The Device explorer selection may contain one or several parameters. When multiple parameters are dropped, processes get stacked in different layers. From the libraries . Processes can also be created by drag &amp; dropping the desired process from the Process library or the User library in the scenario. When doing so, score automatically creates the interval to which process will get attached. You may as well drop a process onto an existing interval. Note that both namespace selection and processes selection can be dropped onto an interval to which some processes are already attached. Depending on the type of processes, these may be created on top of processes already in place or at a slot below. Audio, video and script files (Faust DSP, GLSL fragment shader, JS script…) can also be drag’n’dropped inside a scenario from your desktop’s file manager. By default, dropping several processes at the same time stacks them in the same interval. Holding the Maj key while dropping will create sequential intervals for each item in the selection. If a process is currently selected in the score, it is also possible to create a new process afterwards by double-clicking on it in the library. This will only work if the processes are compatible: the first output port of the selected process must be of the same type than the first input port of the process double-clicked in the library. A connection between the two ports will automatically be made. This allows to easily chain effects: . Likewise, if an output port is currently selected in the score, double-clicking on a process in the list will create and connect it afterwards if compatible. ",

    "content": "Saving your device current state on the timeline is as easy as dragging parameters you want to save from the Device explorer to where you will want them to be recalled in the timeline. You can store at one place all parameters of a device or only part of, as well as parameters from different devices. Note that when selecting a node in the namespace, all parameters below get selected. You may also select a single or many parameters using standard key combinations: . | Shift+click: Select all parameters between clicked parameter and previously selected one | Ctrl+click(Win / Linux) or⌘+click(Mac): Add selected parameter to the current selection | . In the illustration below, we will select just the gain parameters from our ossia compatible Max synth patch and store their current value at the 5th bar of our scenario. As you drop these gain parameters on the timeline, you can see a blue disc circled in white gets created. Clicking this state icon, you can see in the inspector panel both parameters and their value listed as a tree-like view. If you start playing your scenario using the play button from the transport (space key), this state will get recalled and sent to your device as the play-head crosses its position on the timeline. Should you need this state to be recalled earlier or later, just stop execution of the scenario (using stop button from the transport bar or ↵ key), then select and drag it along the timeline. If your device does not echo back its parameters changes to score, you can still grab the parameters to store from the Device explorer and drop them on the Timeline. Then from the state inspector panel, type the desired value next to each parameter. You may as well type the desired values in the Device explorer first, then drag &amp; drop the parameters on the timeline. You may now make some changes to your device, then store this new state using the same drag &amp; drop workflow. Note that when storing our device’s second state in the timeline, score proposes to bind this snapshot to different elements in the timeline, as displayed with a dashed gray line. For now, we will just make sure this snapshot is bound to the first one we placed on the timeline. But be sure to check dedicated section in the manual to see the features score provides to help you structure elements in your scenario. You can now start sequencing your devices’ states in your scenario or read detailed information about managing states and automations. ",

As of score 3, auto-sequence is an option that needs to be activated from the software preferences. To do so, bring up the Settings window. In the Settings window, select the User interface tab then make sure the auto-sequence option is toggled. Using auto-sequence . In previous sections, we saw how to drag parameters from the Device explorer to easily store your device’s state on the timeline as well as drag some processes (in this case automation). Auto-sequence kind of allows us to do both in one go. In the example below, we will start by storing an initial state for our device. Then after making some changes to our device, rather than dropping the parameters from the Device explorer to the timeline again, we will instead use the blue + icon next to the state icon and drag the link to a later point in the timeline. What’s happening here is twofold: . | storing a new state using that blue + button will store the device’s state using the namespace selection defined in the previous stored state | using the auto-sequence option, score will automatically create some automations for the parameter that changed between initial state and newly created state | . You may also store a new state by dragging from the blue + icon without auto-sequence mode activated. In that case, score will still use the previous namespace selection to store parameters values but no automation will get created for changed parameters. Of course, once these automations get auto-magically created, you can still edit their behavior over time and make any pleasing changes to their curve. You may also remove an automation should you want not to include a parameter continuous change. Note on multiple automations editing . In the example above, you can see multiple automation slots actually got superposed. You can bring to front any of the automations in background to edit it. To do so, click on the address bar at the top of the slot to open up the list of superposed parameters ‘automation. Select in the contextual menu the one to edit. Once to front (displayed in red), it can be edited. When multiple automations are stacked, the frontmost one is drawn with a red line, while the ones behind are drawn with a greyed out line . You can also remove an automation from the stack by clicking on a slot background. Bring up the contextual menu using right-click and select remove. ",

All the child intervals of this interval will however use this interval’s tempo, unless them theyselve get a tempo curve. This allows to write poly-tempo scores. If values are sent to the tempo process’s input port, then the curve is not used and the port instead is used as source for the parent interval’s tempo. ",

To reencode a video into HAP, you can use ffmpeg from the command-line (or the Handbrake GUI). $ ffmpeg -i source.mov -c:v hap &lt;OPTIONS&gt; output.mov $ ffmpeg -i source.mov -c:v hap -format hap_alpha outputName.mov $ ffmpeg -i source.mov -c:v hap -format hap_q outputName.mov $ ffmpeg -i source.mov -c:v hap -compressor none outputName.mov $ ffmpeg -i source.mov -c:v hap -format hap_q -chunks 4 outputName.mov .

Thus you can write medias playing and distant devices remote control at a single place. In the example below, we just want to play one audio file synchronously with some automations already in place. Rather than dropping our audio file on the timeline and align things by hand, we can just drop it on the automation’s slot top bar so it sticks to it. In this particular case, you may notice though that the dropped sound file is shorter than the full length of the automation. Just bring the audio file inspector and toggle the loop mode. Now when playing the scenario, the audio file will loop as long as the automation is playing. ",

    "title": "Adding audio effects",
    "content": "Contrary to some other software, score does not rely so much on the studio recording metaphor involving the usual mixing desk, per track FX, fixed busses and so on. Rather, it relies much more on a time-based modular approach. Without going too much into details of score engine for now, let’s just say that it offers to have a unique sound chain (audio source, FX or modulators) for each block of the scenario involving audio. As illustrated below, you can easily add some FX, either from the built-in library or some VST effects installed on your computer to some audio file in your scenario. When dropped, a patch-like workspace is created. For demonstration purpose here, we will just add a simple gain controller. Below the sound file waveform, you can note a red dot. This actually is the audio output. We can just drag a cable from this red dot down to the red circle (its input) at the left of the gain FX. When playing the scenario, audio file will now play through this simple FX and go out to the main output. Again, when the play-head gets beyond the automation’s slot, audio will get fully bypassed (hence preventing from any CPU drain). Feel free to get familiar with this patch workspace using other audio FX or VST of your own collection. You may also note some yellow circle and frames. These are respectively control input and output of some processes parameter. Should you feel adventurous, have fun checking the Control folder in the Process library to add modulation to your FX’s parameters. ",
