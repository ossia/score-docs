# LED design

*score* provides a set of facilities to create content for LED shows: 

- Compatibility with LED hardware either through DMX or directly through SPI.
- Authoring tools to create and visualize RGB data.

## Tools of the trade
### List of useful devices

- [[Art-Net Device]]: when created without any fixture, the raw DMX channels will be available, as well as the ability to send raw messages to the whole device.

### List of useful objects

Most of the objects useful for LED shows are in the process library, in the `Control > Mappings` and `Control > Generators` categories.

- [[Array utilities|Array tool]]
- [[Array utilities|Array combiner]]
- [[Array utilities|Array recombiner]]
- [[Array utilities|Array flattener]]
- [[Math expressions|Arraygen]]
- [[Math expressions|Arraymap]]

To generate LED content from shaders, one can use the [[Pixel utilities|Lightness Computer]] object which will convert an input texture into a series of pixels.

To visualize LED output, one can use the [[Pixel utilities|LED View]] process.

## Controlling LEDs from a shader

An easy way to get great visual results is by leveraging existing [[ISF Shaders]] from the shader library (or create custom ones!).
The [[Pixel utilities|Lightness Computer]] object will convert the texture generated by a shader node into RGB or RGBW pixels ready to be sent to 
LEDs.

## Creating LEDs from generative array computations

To create more generative patterns, or for instance reuse an existing data source, it may be useful to leverage the various array generation tools.
The general workflow would be: 

1. Generate each R, G, B (optionnally W), channel through whatever means. For instance, the [[Math expressions|Arraygen]] object can easily generate an array with N elements.
2. Combine these channels through the [[Array utilities|Array combiner]] object. It sports different modes -- for LED design the most useful would be Intersperse as it would take 
each element of the input array and lay them out one by one, that is given three arrays representing the R, G, B values such as `[ R, R, R, R ] [ G, G, G, G ] [ B, B, B, B ]`
this object will output `[ R G B R G B R G B R G B ]`.
3. The [[Array utilities|Array tool]] object can be used as a processing step, for instance to easily adjust gain and brightness, add padding to each of the arrays or individual arrays.


## Combining multiple LED strips in one array

[Download the example score here]({{ site.scores }}/common-practices/led-design/led-combination.score).

Here again the [[Array utilities|Array tool]] and [[Array utilities|Array combiner]] can be used.

For instance one can pipe the output of each shader to an Array Tool in order to add pre- or post- padding if necessary, or directly to an Array Combiner in Append mode to put each input one after each other.
