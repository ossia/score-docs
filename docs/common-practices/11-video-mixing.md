# Video mixing

The user library provides an eight-channel video mixing object.
It is available in the process library in the section: 

> Visuals > ISF Shader > Utility > Video Mixer

It allows to choose opacity and blend mode for the eight input sources.

Any improvement is welcome !

# Video mapping

Likewise, the library provides a simple 4-point video mapping object (nothing advanced such as smooth edge, etc).
