# Point Cloud to Mesh

The Point Cloud to Mesh process converts point cloud data into 3D mesh geometry for visualization and further processing in ossia score's 3D rendering pipeline.

## Overview

This process takes point cloud data from various sources (texture/raw data) and converts it into a renderable 3D mesh with position and color information. It's particularly useful for working with depth sensor data, LiDAR scans, or other volumetric data sources.

## Parameters

### Input Texture
**Type**: Raw texture data  
**Format**: Raw binary data containing point cloud information

The point cloud data should contain spatial coordinates and optionally color information in a binary format.

### Position
**Type**: 3D Vector (X, Y, Z)  
**Default**: (0, 0, 0)

Sets the world position of the resulting mesh in 3D space.

### Rotation
**Type**: 3D Vector (X, Y, Z) - Euler angles  
**Default**: (0, 0, 0)

Sets the rotation of the resulting mesh around each axis in degrees.

### Scale
**Type**: 3D Vector (X, Y, Z)  
**Default**: (1, 1, 1)

Sets the scale factor for the mesh along each axis.

## Output

### Geometry
**Type**: 3D Mesh with positions and colors  
**Format**: Packed geometry with position and color attributes

The output is a 3D mesh that can be connected to rendering processes like ISF effects, graphics filters, or 3D scene composition nodes.

## Supported Data Formats

The process expects point cloud data in raw binary format containing:
- **Position data**: 3D coordinates (X, Y, Z) as floating-point values
- **Color data**: RGB color information (optional)

## Usage Examples

### Depth Camera Integration
```
Depth Camera → Point Cloud to Mesh → 3D Renderer
```

Connect a depth camera or Kinect device to stream live point cloud data and convert it to renderable meshes.

### LiDAR Visualization
```
LiDAR Data → Point Cloud to Mesh → Geometry Filter → ISF Shader
```

Process LiDAR scan data and apply visual effects for architectural or artistic visualization.

### Interactive Installations
```
Motion Sensor → Point Cloud Generation → Point Cloud to Mesh → Real-time Display
```

Create interactive installations where human movement generates dynamic 3D point clouds.

## Technical Details

### Coordinate System
The process uses a standard 3D coordinate system:
- **X-axis**: Left/Right
- **Y-axis**: Up/Down  
- **Z-axis**: Forward/Backward

### Performance Considerations
- Large point clouds may impact real-time performance
- Consider downsampling dense point clouds for better frame rates
- The mesh generation happens on the GPU when possible

### Memory Usage
Point cloud data can be memory-intensive. The process maintains:
- Input point cloud buffer
- Transformed vertex buffer
- Generated mesh geometry

## Integration with Other Processes

### 3D File Loading
Combine with the **OBJ Loader** process which supports PLY files containing point cloud data:
```
OBJ Loader (.ply) → Point Cloud to Mesh → 3D Scene
```

### Geometry Processing
Chain with other 3D processes:
- **Geometry Filter**: Apply geometric transformations
- **Mesh operations**: Boolean operations, smoothing
- **Material assignment**: Add textures and shading

### Visual Effects
Connect to ISF shader processes for advanced visual effects:
- Particle systems based on point positions
- Dynamic color mapping
- Procedural animation

## Best Practices

### Data Preparation
- Ensure point cloud data is properly formatted
- Consider coordinate system conventions
- Verify color data ranges (0-1 or 0-255)

### Performance Optimization
- Use appropriate mesh resolution for your use case
- Consider level-of-detail (LOD) techniques for distant objects
- Monitor GPU memory usage with large datasets

### Real-time Applications
- Buffer point cloud data for smooth playback
- Use efficient data streaming for live sources
- Consider temporal smoothing for noisy sensors
