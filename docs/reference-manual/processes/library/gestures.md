# Gestures

![Gestures]({{ site.img }}/reference/processes/gestures.png "Gestures")

Recognize and classify gestures from sensor data using the Puara gesture recognition framework. This process analyzes motion patterns, touch interactions, or other sensor inputs to identify specific gestures and trigger corresponding actions.

Perfect for interactive installations, motion-controlled interfaces, dance performances, or any project where human movement needs to be translated into digital control.

## How it works

The Gestures process uses machine learning algorithms to analyze incoming sensor data and match it against trained gesture patterns. It can learn new gestures and recognize them in real-time from various input sources.

**Sensor input** - Motion data from accelerometers, gyroscopes, cameras, or other sensors  
**Gesture training** - Record and train the system to recognize specific gestures  
**Recognition output** - Identified gesture names and confidence levels  
**Real-time processing** - Live gesture recognition with minimal latency

## Supported input sources

**Motion sensors**: Data from [[Wiimote]], smartphone accelerometers, or dedicated motion capture devices.

**Camera tracking**: Gesture recognition from computer vision tracking of body parts or objects.

**Touch interfaces**: Multi-touch gesture recognition from tablets, touchscreens, or touch-sensitive surfaces.

**Custom sensors**: Any sensor data that can be converted to motion or position information.

## Gesture training workflow

**Recording phase**: Perform gestures multiple times while the system records the sensor data patterns.

**Training process**: The system analyzes the recorded patterns and creates recognition models for each gesture.

**Testing and refinement**: Test recognition accuracy and record additional examples to improve reliability.

**Deployment**: Use the trained models for real-time gesture recognition in your interactive system.

## Recognition capabilities

**Multiple gestures**: Train and recognize multiple different gestures simultaneously.

**Confidence scoring**: Get confidence levels for each recognition to filter out uncertain matches.

**Continuous recognition**: Recognize gestures from continuous data streams without explicit start/stop signals.

**User adaptation**: The system can adapt to different users' gesture styles and improve recognition over time.

## Creative applications

**Interactive music**: Create musical instruments controlled by gesture - conduct virtual orchestras, trigger drum sounds with specific movements, or control synthesizer parameters with dance movements.

**Installation control**: Let gallery visitors control lighting, sound, or visual elements through natural gestures without needing to learn complex interfaces.

**Performance enhancement**: Augment live performances with gesture-controlled effects, allowing performers to control technical aspects through movement.

**Therapeutic applications**: Create responsive environments for therapy or rehabilitation where specific movements trigger encouraging feedback.

**Gaming interfaces**: Build motion-controlled games or interactive experiences that respond to player gestures.

## Integration with score

**Action triggering**: Connect gesture recognition to [[Scenario]] elements to trigger scenes, automation sequences, or media playback.

**Parameter control**: Use gesture recognition to switch between different control modes or parameter sets using [[Mapping Tool]].

**Audio effects**: Control [[Audio Effects]] parameters based on recognized gestures - different hand movements could control different aspects of sound processing.

**Visual effects**: Drive [[Video]] processing or lighting changes based on recognized movement patterns.

## Advanced techniques

**Gesture chaining**: Recognize sequences of gestures to create more complex interaction patterns.

**Context sensitivity**: Use different gesture sets in different contexts or scenes for more sophisticated interaction design.

**Multi-user support**: Handle multiple users simultaneously, each with their own gesture recognition context.

**Adaptive thresholds**: Adjust recognition sensitivity based on environmental conditions or user preferences.

## Technical considerations

**Training data**: More training examples generally lead to better recognition accuracy - record gestures in various conditions and styles.

**Environmental factors**: Lighting, background motion, and sensor placement can affect recognition accuracy.

**Processing requirements**: Real-time gesture recognition requires adequate processing power, especially for computer vision-based systems.

**Latency**: Consider the delay between gesture performance and system response when designing interactive experiences.

## Troubleshooting

**Poor recognition**: Record more training examples, check sensor calibration, or adjust recognition thresholds.

**False positives**: Increase confidence thresholds or refine gesture training to be more specific.

**Latency issues**: Optimize processing settings or use faster hardware for real-time applications.

**Inconsistent users**: Train with examples from multiple users or implement user-specific calibration.

Perfect for combining with device protocols like [[Kinect]] or [[Wiimote]] for motion input, [[Mapping Tool]] for gesture-to-parameter conversion, or [[Audio Effects]] and [[Video]] processes for gesture-controlled multimedia experiences.
