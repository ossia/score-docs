# Spammer

![Spammer]({{ site.img }}/reference/processes/spammer.png "Spammer")

Generate rapid bursts of messages for stress-testing systems, creating chaotic effects, or simulating high-frequency data streams. When you need to flood your score with messages at precise intervals, Spammer delivers.

Perfect for testing how your processes handle high message rates, creating granular control effects, or generating dense streams of data for experimental processing.

## How it works

Spammer sends out messages at the rate you specify, allowing you to overwhelm other processes with data or create effects that depend on message density rather than specific values.

**Rate** - How fast to send messages (adjustable frequency)  
**Message** - What to send with each pulse  
**Burst mode** - Send clusters of messages rather than steady streams  
**Duration control** - Limit how long the spam continues

## Practical uses

**Stress testing**: See how your audio effects or control systems handle extreme message rates before live performance.

**Granular effects**: Create dense streams of small parameter changes for texture and movement that couldn't be achieved with single messages.

**System simulation**: Simulate sensor data streams, network traffic, or other high-frequency data sources for testing and development.

**Rhythmic density**: Generate polyrhythmic patterns by combining multiple Spammers at different rates.

**Chaos generation**: Use as a source of controlled chaos in generative compositions.

## Creative applications

Feed Spammer into [[Range Filter]] to create irregular bursts, use with [[MIDI utilities]] to generate impossible-to-play note densities, or combine with [[Audio Effects]] for parameter modulation at audio rates.

Works great for overwhelming [[Mapping Tool]] or [[Calibrator]] processes to test their response characteristics, or use multiple Spammers with different rates to create complex polyrhythmic control patterns.

## Related processes

Chain with [[Rate Limiter]] for controlled bursts, combine with [[Range Filter]] for selective message passing, or feed into [[Trigger]] for density-based event detection. Use [[Logic]] processes to start and stop spam bursts conditionally.
