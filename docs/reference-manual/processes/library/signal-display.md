# Signal Display

![Signal Display]({{ site.img }}/reference/processes/signal-display.png "Signal Display")

Visualize control signals in real-time for monitoring, debugging, and performance feedback. Signal Display shows you exactly what's happening with your parameter data, making it easy to understand signal flow and troubleshoot issues.

Essential for understanding complex control systems, monitoring sensor inputs, or providing visual feedback during performances and installations.

## How it works

Signal Display takes any control signal input and renders it as a real-time graph, showing value changes over time. You can see signal patterns, detect problems, and understand the behavior of your control systems.

**Signal input** - Connect any control signal (floats, integers, arrays)  
**Display modes** - Choose between different visualization styles  
**Time window** - Adjust how much signal history to display  
**Scaling** - Automatic or manual value range scaling

## Visualization features

**Real-time plotting**: See signal values as they change over time with smooth, responsive graphics.

**Multiple signals**: Display several related signals simultaneously for comparison and correlation analysis.

**Zoom and scale**: Adjust time and value ranges to focus on specific aspects of your signal behavior.

**Value readouts**: Get precise numerical readouts alongside the visual display.

## Creative applications

**Performance monitoring**: Watch parameter changes during live performances to ensure everything is working as expected.

**Sensor debugging**: Visualize sensor data to understand noise characteristics, calibration issues, or environmental influences.

**Signal analysis**: Study the behavior of [[LFO]], [[Mapping Tool]], or other control processes to optimize their settings.

**Interactive feedback**: Provide visual feedback to performers or installation users showing how their actions affect the system.

**System optimization**: Monitor CPU usage, timing, or other system metrics to optimize performance.

## Integration techniques

**Multi-channel monitoring**: Use multiple Signal Displays to monitor different aspects of complex systems simultaneously.

**Threshold visualization**: Combine with [[Trigger]] or [[Range Filter]] processes to see exactly when thresholds are crossed.

**Comparative analysis**: Monitor input and output of processing chains to understand how [[Mapping Tool]], [[Audio Effects]], or other processes transform signals.

**Performance documentation**: Record signal behavior for later analysis or to demonstrate system capabilities.

Perfect for debugging [[Mapping Tool]] response curves, monitoring [[Audio Effects]] control parameters, or understanding the output characteristics of sensor-based control systems.

## Related processes

Use alongside [[Mapping Tool]] for parameter optimization, with [[Audio Effects]] for control monitoring, or integrate with any process where understanding signal behavior is important for creative or technical development.
