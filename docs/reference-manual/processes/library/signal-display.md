# Signal Display

![Signal Display]({{ site.img }}/reference/processes/signal-display.png "Signal Display")

Visualize control signals in real-time for monitoring, debugging, and performance feedback. Signal Display shows you exactly what's happening with your parameter data, making it easy to understand signal flow and troubleshoot issues.

Essential for understanding complex control systems, monitoring sensor inputs, or providing visual feedback during performances and installations.

## How it works

Signal Display takes any control signal input and renders it as a real-time graph, showing value changes over time. You can see signal patterns, detect problems, and understand the behavior of your control systems.

**Signal input** - Connect any control signal (floats, integers, arrays)  
**Display modes** - Choose between different visualization styles  
**Time window** - Adjust how much signal history to display  
**Scaling** - Automatic or manual value range scaling

If the signal has multiple dimensions, they will be shown one above each other.
