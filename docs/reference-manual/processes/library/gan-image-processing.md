# GAN Image Processing

![GAN Image Processing]({{ site.img }}/reference/processes/gan-processing.png "GAN Image Processing")

Transform and enhance existing images using GAN-based processing models. This process supports various enhancement and style transfer applications.

## Overview

The GAN Image Processing applies pre-trained GAN models to modify input images. Supported models include:
- AnimeGANv3 - Convert photos to anime style
- DeblurGAN - Remove motion blur and enhance sharpness
- FSRGan - Super-resolution and detail enhancement
- Custom image-to-image GAN models

## Inputs

| Port | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Input Image | Texture | Source image to process |
| Strength | Float (0-1) | Processing intensity |
| Mask | Texture | Optional processing mask |
| Reference | Texture | Style reference (model-dependent) |

## Outputs

| Port | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Processed Image | Texture | The processed result |
| Original | Texture | Pass-through of input |
| Blend | Texture | Blended original/processed |

## Parameters

| Parameter | Widget | Description | Default | Range |
|-----------|--------|-------------|---------|-------|
| Model | File Selector | Path to ONNX model | - | .onnx files |
| Mode | Dropdown | Processing mode | "Full" | Full, Masked, Adaptive |
| Blend Amount | Slider | Mix with original | 1.0 | 0.0-1.0 |
| Quality | Dropdown | Processing quality | "High" | Low, Medium, High |
| Preserve Colors | Toggle | Maintain original colors | Off | On/Off |

## Supported Models

### AnimeGANv3
Converts photographic images to anime/manga style.

Features:
- Multiple style variants
- Face-aware processing
- Temporal consistency for video

### DeblurGAN
Removes various types of blur from images.

Applications:
- Motion blur removal
- Focus enhancement
- Old photo restoration

### FSRGan (Face Super-Resolution)
Enhances facial details and resolution.

Use cases:
- Portrait enhancement
- Video call improvement
- Archive restoration

## Usage Examples

### Live Camera Enhancement

Process camera input in real-time:

```
[Camera Device] → [GAN Processing] → [Window Device]
                        ↑
                  [AnimeGANv3 Model]
```

### Selective Processing

Use masks for targeted enhancement:

```
[Video Input] → [GAN Processing] → [Output]
                      ↑
[Face Detection] → [Mask]
```

### Multi-Stage Processing

Chain multiple GAN processors:

```
[Input] → [DeblurGAN] → [FSRGan] → [Color Correction] → [Output]
```

## Performance Considerations

### Real-time Processing
- Use lower resolution inputs for live processing
- Enable GPU acceleration
- Consider frame-skipping for complex models

### Batch Processing
- Process multiple frames in parallel
- Use queue systems for non-real-time
- Implement caching for repeated inputs

## Creative Techniques

### Style Mixing

Blend multiple style models:

1. Process with Model A at 50% strength
2. Process result with Model B at 50% strength
3. Fine-tune with color correction

### Temporal Smoothing

For video processing:
- Enable temporal consistency modes
- Use frame blending for smoother transitions
- Apply motion-aware processing

### Interactive Control

Map controls to processing parameters:

```
[MIDI Fader] → [Strength]
[OSC Control] → [Blend Amount]
[Sensor] → [Model Selection]
```

## Model Configuration

### Input Requirements
Different models expect different input formats:
- Resolution (typically 256x256 or 512x512)
- Color space (RGB, BGR)
- Normalization range ([0,1] or [-1,1])

### Output Handling
- Match output resolution to downstream processes
- Handle color space conversions
- Manage alpha channels appropriately

## Troubleshooting

### Quality Issues
- Ensure input resolution matches model expectations
- Check color space conversions
- Verify model weights are loaded correctly

### Performance Problems
- Reduce processing resolution
- Increase frame skip
- Use simpler models
- Check GPU memory usage

## Best Practices

1. **Input Preparation**: Pre-process inputs to match model requirements
2. **Quality vs. Speed**: Balance quality settings with performance needs
3. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate models for content type
4. **Temporal Consistency**: Use frame blending for video
5. **Resource Management**: Monitor GPU usage and heat

## Integration Examples

### Live Performance Setup
```
[Camera] → [GAN Processing] → [Shader Effects] → [Projector]
              ↑                      ↑
        [Style Selection]    [Audio Reactive]
```

### Installation Pipeline
```
[Multiple Cameras] → [Switch] → [GAN Processing] → [Compositor]
                         ↑              ↑                ↓
                   [Presence Sensor] [Settings]    [LED Wall]
```
