# Graphics Utilities

![Graphics Utilities]({{ site.img }}/reference/processes/graphics-utilities.png "Graphics Utilities")

A collection of essential tools for graphics processing, image manipulation, and visual effects. These utilities provide building blocks for creating complex visual systems and processing graphics data in real-time.

Perfect for video art, projection mapping, interactive visuals, or any project that needs graphics processing beyond basic video playback.

## Available tools

The Graphics Utilities collection includes various specialized processes for different aspects of graphics work:

**Image processing**: Color manipulation, filtering, and transformation tools for still images and video frames.

**Texture generation**: Procedural texture creation and pattern generation for dynamic visual content.

**Coordinate transformation**: Tools for mapping between different coordinate systems, essential for projection mapping and spatial graphics.

**Color space conversion**: Convert between RGB, HSV, LAB, and other color representations for precise color control.

**Geometric operations**: Shape manipulation, scaling, rotation, and distortion effects for dynamic visual transformations.

## Creative applications

**Projection mapping**: Use coordinate transformation tools to map visuals onto irregular surfaces and architectural features.

**Interactive installations**: Process camera input or sensor data to create responsive visual environments.

**Video effects**: Apply real-time processing to video streams for live performance or installation work.

**Generative art**: Create evolving visual patterns using procedural texture generation and color manipulation.

**Data visualization**: Transform numerical data into visual representations using color mapping and geometric tools.

## Integration with score

Graphics Utilities work seamlessly with [[Video]] processes for comprehensive visual systems. They can be controlled by [[Mapping Tool]] for parameter automation, synchronized with [[Audio Effects]] for audio-reactive visuals, or driven by sensor data from various device protocols.

**Performance optimization**: Graphics utilities are designed for real-time operation, with efficient algorithms that maintain smooth frame rates even with complex processing chains.

**Modular design**: Each utility can be used independently or combined with others to create sophisticated visual processing pipelines.

**Parameter control**: All graphics operations can be controlled by *score*'s automation system, allowing for precise timing and complex visual sequences.

## Technical features

**GPU acceleration**: Where available, graphics utilities use hardware acceleration for optimal performance with high-resolution content.

**Multiple formats**: Support for various image and video formats, with automatic format conversion when needed.

**Real-time processing**: Optimized for live performance and interactive applications with minimal latency.

**Memory efficiency**: Intelligent memory management prevents issues with large textures and long-running installations.
