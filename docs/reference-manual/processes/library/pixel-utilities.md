# Pixel Utilities

![Pixel Utilities]({{ site.img }}/reference/processes/pixel-utilities.png "Pixel Utilities")

Work with individual pixels and pixel-level operations for precise graphics control and analysis. These utilities let you examine, manipulate, and extract data from images at the pixel level for detailed visual processing.

Perfect for LED installations, pixel mapping, color analysis, or any application where you need precise control over individual picture elements.

## Available utilities

The Pixel Utilities collection includes specialized tools for different aspects of pixel-level work:

### Lightness Computer
Extract luminance and brightness information from visual content for control purposes. This utility analyzes pixel brightness to generate control signals.

**Color analysis**: Convert RGB pixel data to luminance values for brightness-based control.

**Region sampling**: Extract brightness from specific areas of images or video for targeted control.

**Averaging modes**: Various methods for combining pixel data - mean, maximum, weighted averages.

**Real-time processing**: Fast pixel analysis suitable for live video processing and control generation.

### LED View
Specialized display for LED installations and pixel-mapped lighting systems.

**Pixel mapping**: Direct mapping between image pixels and physical LED arrays.

**Color correction**: Per-pixel color adjustment for accurate LED reproduction.

**Brightness scaling**: Automatic scaling for different LED brightness characteristics.

**Layout configuration**: Support for various LED strip layouts and configurations.

## Creative applications

**LED installations**: Drive LED strips, matrices, or architectural lighting directly from visual content with pixel-perfect accuracy.

**Color extraction**: Extract color information from live video or images to control lighting, audio parameters, or other systems.

**Visual analysis**: Analyze visual content for brightness patterns, color distribution, or movement detection.

**Pixel art**: Create and manipulate pixel-art content with precise control over individual picture elements.

**Data visualization**: Convert numerical data into pixel patterns for visual representation and analysis.

## Integration techniques

**Video to control**: Use pixel analysis to convert visual content into control signals for [[Audio Effects]], spatial audio positioning, or other parameter control.

**LED synchronization**: Synchronize LED displays with audio content by analyzing visual representations of sound.

**Interactive visuals**: Create systems where pixel-level analysis of camera input drives visual or audio responses.

**Color mapping**: Extract color palettes from images and apply them to other visual or lighting systems.

## Technical features

**High-performance processing**: Optimized algorithms for real-time pixel operations even with high-resolution content.

**Multiple color spaces**: Support for RGB, HSV, LAB, and other color representations for flexible pixel analysis.

**Sampling patterns**: Various methods for selecting and analyzing pixel data - random sampling, grid patterns, region-based analysis.

**Memory efficiency**: Smart caching and processing to handle large images without excessive memory usage.

## LED installation workflow

1. **Configure your LED layout** - Define the physical arrangement of your LEDs
2. **Set up pixel mapping** - Map image pixels to physical LED positions  
3. **Calibrate colors** - Adjust for LED color characteristics and brightness
4. **Test the installation** - Verify pixel-accurate mapping and color reproduction
5. **Optimize performance** - Adjust processing settings for smooth real-time operation

## Performance considerations

**Resolution scaling**: Higher resolution content requires more processing power - balance quality with performance needs.

**Update rates**: Consider LED refresh rates and processing capabilities when setting update frequencies.

**Color accuracy**: Different LEDs have different color characteristics - calibration is essential for accurate reproduction.

**Power management**: Large LED installations can consume significant power - plan electrical requirements accordingly.
