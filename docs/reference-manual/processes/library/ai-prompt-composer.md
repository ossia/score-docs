# AI Prompt Composer

Build dynamic AI prompts from multiple text inputs. Perfect for interactive installations where you want prompts to change based on sensor data, user input, or other real-time information.

This process takes separate text components and intelligently combines them into well-formed prompts for AI image generators, language models, or other prompt-based systems.
