Visualize control signals in real-time for monitoring, debugging, and performance feedback. 
LED View is a monitoring tool specialized for visualizing an input array as either RGB, RGBA, or individual values between [0; 1] or [0; 255].

It is useful for instance for visualizing arrays of LEDs, or arrays with large numbers of elements where [[Signal Display]] becomes impractical.
