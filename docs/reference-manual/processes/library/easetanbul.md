# Easetanbul

![Easetanbul]({{ site.img }}/reference/processes/easetanbul.gif "Easetanbul")

Create smooth transitions between values with professional easing curves. Instead of abrupt parameter changes, Easetanbul provides fluid, organic movement that feels natural and polished.

Essential for creating smooth animations, gentle parameter transitions, or any time you need to interpolate between different values with precise timing control.

## Related processes

[[Tweener]] is the value alter-ego of Easetanbul: while [[Easetanbul]] tweens between incoming values, Tweener tweens between its two inlets.

[[Automation]] allows to tween but only between one value known in advance and one unknown, [[Easetanbul]] instead tweens continuously between incoming values.
