# Timeline and Patches

![Timeline and Patches]({{ site.img }}/examples/basics/timeline-and-patches.png "Combining timeline and patches in ossia score")

This example demonstrates how ossia score combines timeline-based composition with dataflow patching.

## Overview

The score shows how audio processes can be chained together using cables while still being organized temporally on a timeline. This hybrid approach allows you to:

- Sequence audio playback over time
- Apply real-time effects with parameter automation
- Create complex signal chains using the patch system

## Try it

Download and open this example in ossia score to explore the timeline structure and patch connections.
