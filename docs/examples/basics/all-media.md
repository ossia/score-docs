This example demonstrates ossia score's ability to patch together diverse media types including audio, video, 3D geometries, and textures in a unified workflow.

## Overview

Unlike traditional software where audio, video, and 3D are handled separately, ossia score allows you to connect them all using the same cable-based patching system.

## Try it

Open this example to see how different media types flow through the same patching interface.
