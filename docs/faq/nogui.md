# How to run *score* without GUI ?

Score can run in the background while not opening its full UI (which may be handy for example when running score in a video installation). To do so, you can launch score from the Command line using the following:

```bash
`$ ossia-score --no-gui --autoplay /home/oscar/my-score.score`
```

You may find other useful commands in the [[Command line API|command line reference page]].
